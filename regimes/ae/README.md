# United Arab Emirates (AE) Tax Regime

This document provides an overview of the tax regime in the United Arab Emirates.

## Value-Added Tax (VAT)

The UAE VAT system categorizes goods and services into three main VAT rates:

- **Standard Rate (5%)**: Applies to most goods and services in the UAE.
- **Zero Rate (0%)**: Applies to certain essential goods, exports, and specific services.
- **Exempt**: Certain types of goods and services are exempt from VAT, including some financial services or residential real estate.

Businesses required to charge VAT must register with the UAE Federal Tax Authority to obtain a Tax Registration Number (TRN). Registration can be completed online via the [VAT registration portal](https://tax.gov.ae/en/services/vat.registration.aspx).

## VAT Registration Requirements

Businesses in the UAE must evaluate their eligibility for VAT registration based on their revenue and expenses. The registration requirements are as follows:

- **Mandatory Registration**: Businesses are required to register for VAT if the total value of taxable supplies and imports exceeds **AED 375,000** in a 12-month period.
- **Voluntary Registration**: Businesses may choose to register voluntarily if the total value of taxable supplies and imports, or taxable expenses, exceeds **AED 187,500** within a 12-month period.

**Note:** Businesses below the voluntary registration threshold are not permitted to register for VAT and, therefore, will issue invoices without a TRN.

### TRN Validation

Currently, no checksum method is available for validating the TRN. Therefore, verification must be performed directly through the official UAE government website.

### Alcohol Sales Tax

In Dubai, a **30% sales tax** on alcohol previously existed but has since been abolished. Some sources suggest that a similar tax persists in Abu Dhabi, but without official confirmation, this has not been included in the UAE tax regime.

## VAT Invoicing Requirements

There are two types of VAT invoices: the standard and the simplified invoice.

**Simplified VAT Invoice**: Allowed in the following cases:

- When the recipient of goods or services is **not VAT registered**.
- When the recipient of goods or services **is VAT registered**, and the transaction value does not exceed **AED 10,000**.
