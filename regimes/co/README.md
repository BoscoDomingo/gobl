# GOBL Colombia Tax Regime

## Zones

Colombia requires zones to be defined in supplier and customer party's tax identity.

## Invoice Series & Code

Invoices ("Facturas de Venta") as expected in many countries require a series and unique sequential code to be issued for each document. The DIAN in colombia however have gone a step further and require invoice series to be pre-registered with the government.

Details on how to do this are available [here](https://www.dian.gov.co/impuestos/sociedades/presentacionclientes/Solicitud_de_Autorizacion_de_Numeracion_de_Facturacion.pdf).
