## Public Documentations

### FatturaPA

[Historical Documentations](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/en/norme-e-regole/documentazione-fattura-elettronica/formato-fatturapa/)

[Schema V1.2.1 Spec Table View (EN)](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/documenti/fatturapa/v1.2.1/Table-view-B2B-Ordinary-invoice.pdf) - by far the most comprehensible spec doc. Since the difference between 1.2.2 and 1.2.1 is minimal, this is perfectly usable.

[Schema V1.2.2 PDF (IT)](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/documenti/Specifiche_tecniche_del_formato_FatturaPA_v1.3.1.pdf) - most up-to-date but difficult

[XSD V1.2.2](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/documenti/fatturapa/v1.2.2/Schema_del_file_xml_FatturaPA_v1.2.2.xsd)

### Italy-specific Details

#### Stamp Duty

Add an invoice-level `bill.Charge` and use `it.ChargeKeyStampDuty` as the `bill.Charge.Key`.

#### Numero REA

`Party.Registration` is used to store the Numero REA (Registro delle Imprese) of the company.
The `Office` field is used to store the Provincia (Province) of the company, the `Entry` field is used to store the Numero REA. Additionally, the share capital is stored in the `Capital` field used in conjunction with `Currency`.

#### Local Codes

FatturaPA demands very specific categorization for the type of economic activity,
document type, fund type, etc.

##### RegimeFiscale (Tax System)

The "Regime Fiscale" or tax system needs to be applied to all Italian FatturaPA invoices. The default code `RF01` will always be used unless overridden by specifying one of the following tax tags in the invoice document:

| Code | Document Tags        | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |

##### ModalitaPagamento (Payment Means)

The following table describes how to map the Italian payment means codes to those of GOBL. The list is somewhat based on the official mapping of the FatturaPA codes to EU Semantic invoice definition, more details available [here](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/documents/20143/288396/Technical+Rules+for+European+Invoicing+v2.1.pdf).

##### TipoDocumento (Document Type)

All Italian invoices must be identified with a specific type code defined by the FatturaPA format. The following table helps identify how GOBL will map the expected Italian code with a combination of the Invoice Type and tax tags.

| Code | Type          | Tax Tags                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
